						<p class="chapter-textstyle">
							Hospitality does not translate itself only from human to human. It can also be through the form of design. Information in a restaurant’s menu, on the signs at a train station or the text in a flyer can also become a form of hospitality. If the information is clear enough for the guest, tourist or customer, they can benefit from that information. However, if information is only provided in one (unknown) language or contains too much information which makes the core of the message becomes unclear, this might result into a distant feeling and probably the opposite of what omotenashi stands for. Again I shall describe some examples from the Japanese culture, to dive further into the way they combine design and hospitality.
							<br/><br/>
							INFORMATIVE DISAPPOINTMENT <br/>
							Design can also be confusing and disappointing. Several times I experienced being a little lost at the train stations in Japan and hoping to find some information regarding the schedules. Above all the rapid moving heads rose a sign with big black letters: INFORMATION. Instantly I tried to make my way through the mass towards the bulletin board. When I finally reached my destination I came to the bitter realisation that it was only the title that was written in English. All the other information was in Japanese. How on earth, as a tourist, would I be able to get any understanding from this, to me, unknown language?
							<br/><br/>
							The most gnawing question was: Why would they even take the effort of translating the title into English if the rest of the text is not understandable for the English readers? What sadistic form of hospitality is this? It is understandable that in the mountains the Japanese do not provide information in English. Logically restaurants in non-touristic places only have Japanese menus and ryokans (Japanese traditional hotels) have their toilets and bathrooms marked with Japanese characters. This is all because English is not the second language in Japan and not many people speak, or dare to speak, English. However, in
							a metropolis like Tokyo you would expect more information directed to tourists. You would actually expect the information written in several different languages, if you think about the way of hospitality the Japanese love so much. Unfortunately that is far from the truth.
							<br/><br/>
							When there is finally some English text provided, let’s say in advertisement or menus, you would not know where to start reading. Japanese have two types of design: the pure and clear, simple design, and the extremely colourful design full of text, images and illustrations. That latter is the most common in Japanese daily life. You have to wriggle yourself through many layers of useless information before you get to the core.
							<br/><br/>
							In other words: perhaps not such a tourist-friendly country after all? Not in the places you would at least expect it to be. Even though they do their utmost to help you when you enter their shop or got lost on a train station, it seems to lack some develop- ment here and there regarding information, even in their designs.
							<br/><br/>
							PRACTICALITIES <br/>
							The Japanese, however, are very good with designing nifty products. All crazy inventions you never knew you would ever need, (and perhaps will never need, but just want to have for the fun of it.) Things like little egg-shaped boxes to carry your egg in so it does not get squashed in your bag (all designed
							cutely, because that is what Japanese love); robot cleaners that work as scavengers in the office, bumping up to your chair and feet as if it were a real pet; a cupholder next to a cash machine so you have both hands free to take your rolled out money... Yes, I have seen it all. Even so, how crazy all these inventions may sound, they are very practical and gratify (sometimes unknown) needs.
							<br/><br/>
							HUMAN INTERACTION <br/>
							Then there is a point where we lost all human interaction. It is perfectly fine that hospitality is transferred through design, but should design be a total replacement of interaction with humans?
							<br/><br/>
							A woman at the information stand, greeting you with blinking eyes and a modest smile. Ask her your question and she will answer in perfect English. However, when you try to make jokes or start asking difficult questions that require detailed answers, the woman does not respond. She merely blinks her eyes and moves her head a little from left to right. This lifelike woman had been the creepiest robot that greeted me. She was, however, a rare encounter.
							<br/><br/>
							In many Japanese shops visitors are welcomed by a robot called Pepper. Made of white solid material, with the height of a 6-year old and colour-changing led-light eyes. Sometimes they are dressed up like a true host. Just one problem for foreigners: Pepper only speaks Japanese. Or perhaps Pepper was able to speak English, but we just did not know how to ask the right question or to find the right button in order to change the language. In that case, not so customer-friendly. The only thing it did to us was freaking us out, for Pepper’s head would follow us wherever we went, and its lifelike little hands would twist and turn as if it were from a real person. Luckily it could not walk or ride. Even though the Japanese try hard to create robots that look like humans that are programmed to answer your (simple) questions, the robots cannot live up to the true hospitality of human beings. They cannot emphasize with human beings or anticipate the wishes of the person who is approaching.
							<br/><br/>
							One step too far in the wrong direction of hospitality, I would say. Nice attempt, but not yet sufficiently working for foreigners that are not accustomed to non-human encounters. Besides, it does not feel personal at all and since the Japanese hospitality is all about ‘from the heart’, it would be very misplaced, since robots do not have a heart.

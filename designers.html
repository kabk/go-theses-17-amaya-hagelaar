							Hospitality in design is rather a form of inviting people and creating a space where strangers can become friends. Where one can feel at ease and dare to be vulnerable. To come to understand how forms of hospitality have already been used in the process of design we can look at different designers with their own way of implementing hospitality in their projects, consciously or unconsciously. How did these designers use a way of under- standing and providing possibilities in their projects?
							<br/><br/>
							STEFAN SAGMEISTER <br/>
							If we are talking about vulnerability ‘The Happy Show’ by Stefan Sagmeister* would be a good example. Not so much for the public becoming the vulnerable object, but rather the designer himself. Perhaps vulnerability might not always be a quality, since critics might find it annoying and can take it for self-pity. Even so, Sagmeister did pull it off well in The Happy Show, where he invited people to be part of his thoughts; offer them
							a look in his world. His intentions are probably to show people something they perhaps had never thought about.
							<br/><br/>
							Although The Happy Show3 was a collection of Sagmeister his own views upon the topic ‘happiness’, it did ask for the engage- ment of the public during the exhibition. It was through playful- ness that he carried on his research. With black on a yellow background he displayed emotional infographics, big headlines, fun videos, interesting and interactive installations and much more. With all these different representations of happiness he intended to show visitors his way of thinking.
							<br/><br/>
							Sagmeister is dedicated to his works and does more of these dedications of his mind and body in some other projects. For example the AIGA lecture event poster from 1999, where he carved text into his body. Or at his 2003 exhibition ‘Sagmeister on a binge’ you could see before and after pictures of him after he had stuffed himself with a hundred different types of junk food which made him gain more than twenty-five pounds.
							<br/><br/>
							TRUE <br/>
							Sagmeister had mentioned David John Riggins**, artist name TRUE, in an earlier TEDtalk.4 Riggins is an American artist, designer and filmmaker and is seen as ‘leading design innovator’.5 Why Riggins makes an interesting example for my research of hospitality is that he uses natural surroundings as an art space. By avoiding galleries and museums he tries to employ his idea that art should be displayed for a bigger public. I think it is a good solution for free and open art, available for everyone.
							<br/><br/>
							One of his occasional ‘guerilla’ projects was called ‘Life Instruc- tions’.6 Executed in a subway where he and some of his friends would place another sign over the original signs. The signs contained funny and sometimes provocative messages to trigger public to think differently and pay more attention to their surroun- dings and the details it includes. However, people do not often pay attention to these signs so the change was not always noticed.
							<br/><br/>
							There is something inimical even so. He violates public space and makes probably necessary information unreadable. Nevertheless, with this Riggins shows a sort of selflessness through being vulnerable, by doing things that can get him caught. He puts the need to ‘inform’ others above his own safety. Atop of that he shows loyalty towards his friends. When his friends would be caught he wanted them not to be put in a difficult situation, therefore he provided them with a ‘volunteer card’.
							<br/><br/>
							However, I think Riggins is not fully vulnerable. He wants to give something to others, except for his identity. He tries to remain out of sight from the press. Before, he used a pseudonym ‘str8up’ in order to sustain his anonymity, and to not lead away the attention from his work to himself, as well as a protection from getting caught for violating the government property.7
							<br/><br/>
							CANDY CHANG <br/>
							Another artist/designer who makes use of public spaces is Candy Change. Her work, in my opinion, lives up closest to narrowing the boundaries between the individual and the collective. She picks ones brain when it comes to the psychology of the community’s involvement. The public is invited to reflect on themselves and their environment, and what the relationship is between the public space and mental health of both the individual as the collective.8 Her projects are open for public and are mainly interactive experi- ments that offer ways to start a dialogue with and between the local community.
							<br/><br/>
							‘Before I Die’ is one of the most widely spread projects, since it had been set up in more than seventy countries. This is a great example of a participatory public art project. By stencilling the words ‘Before I Die’ repeatedly on a black wall with a set of lines for public to finish the sentence, she creates a space where everyone is invited to reflect on life and death, and share their own envision with others.
							<br/><br/>
							The beauty of this project is that it did not end with just one wall. As a matter of fact, it is a never-ending project. While people are asked to participate by writing on the wall, they are also free to replicate this wall somewhere else. Even better, this is a wonderful example of hospitality by creating opportunities: Chang offers a guide on how to set up your own wall including five easy steps, a checklist of what you need and a stencil.9 This way a project can become an adjustable and transmittable form of hospitality.
							<br/><br/>
							Furthermore Chang gives people, who are interested to set up their own project, the freedom to use this concept. Questions from the website’s FAQ like “Can I change the wording of ‘Before I Die’?” and “Do I need to follow the exact composition of the original wall?”10 are answered with the motivation that you can do whatever you feel inspired to do or whatever feels right. In every way this project is an invitation to let your own creativity or motivation run free and execute it yourself in any way you want. Now more than 2,000 walls have been set up and still people are using this concept. In The Netherlands there have been three ‘Before I Die’-walls (recorded on the project’s website). One in Amsterdam, Eindhoven and March 2016 in Almelo.
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“Before I die I want to meet the aliens.”</a> <br/>
							- Eindhoven, September 2011
							<br/><br/>
							Since people could adjust the text freely, there had been some ‘remixes’. In 2013 the community of Ermelo raised a wall with the title “What makes Ermelo the place to be?” And in Leeuwarden the students of Noordelijke Hogeschool raised a temporary one in November 2011 named “Before I Graduate” which left mostly very student-like answers, but also weird, creative ideas, sad stories and ambitious plans.
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">
							“Loose my virginity.” <br/>
							“Have a naked photoshoot.” <br/>
							“Eat a shark.” <br/>
							“Find friends who won’t leave me.” <br/>
							“Have my own company.”
							</a>
							<br/><br/>
							Besides ‘Before I Die’ Chang raised many more of these projects that ask for engagement and where remembering and reflecting are important aspects. She gives opportunities for reflection and developing your own ideas of life. It might also be an attempt to point people, or actually let them point themselves, towards their goals, without being pushy or demanding. Everyone can join in their own pace.
							The goal for most artists like Chang could be that they are able to change something in society. That people in this world look differently upon their lives and what they still would like to achieve before it is too late. It reveals ambition, fear, happiness, difficulties, and many other feelings that someone might not have been aware of. Hopefully it creates self-reflection but also empathy and compassion towards others. In a way hospitality has been used for a design purpose and translated back into hospitality that is again passed onto another. That to me is the right way to invite people and pass on your message. Something I would like to aspire in my graduation project.
							<br/><br/>
							DAVE HAKKENS <br/>
							When thinking about designers that would like to make a change Dave Hakkens is a great example. Not only because he now lives in the city that I grew up in, which always makes me really proud to say Helmond delivers great people, but because he has found a way to offer possibilities that can develop our environment. Hakkens graduated in 2013 from the Design Academy in Eindhoven. He won the design awards with his project ‘Precious Plastic’.11
							<br/><br/>
							The project introduces a way to recycle plastic yourself. On the website tutorials are provided on how to build your own recycle machines. Hakkens tries to encourage the public to become conscious of the enormous plastic waste this world now contains and to do something about it. Consciousness is a form of hospitality, as it is anticipating. Hakkens anticipated the need, not so much of the people, but rather of Mother Nature. He calls for others to become aware of what is happening, and not by scattering around some sad whiny cries, but purely with an offer that cannot be ignored. Same as Candy Chang, Hakkens offers the public a free setup of how to make your own plastic recycle machine and how to make filament (ink for the 3D printer.)12
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“People can play around, start a business and recycle like rockstars.”</a> 13
							<br/><br/>
							Yet, it is not something everyone is able to do. For instance, I would really want to recycle my own plastic, however I do not have the materials, let alone the money to buy the materials, nor have I got the space to store these machines. Which makes it quite complex to fabricate yourself. Nevertheless is this a very exquisite pursuance and serves useful opportunities.
							<br/><br/>
							BILL MOGGRIDGE <br/>
							An early example of how the helpful thinking of one person has translated itself into design is from Bill Moggridge. Born in London, 1943 as William Grant Moggridge and later studying Industrial Design at Central ST. Martins College of Art and Design, Moggridge worked in his adult life as co-founder of IDEO. Not only is IDEO one of the most successful design firms in the world, it was also one of the first to emerge the design of software and hardware with industrial design. Some people see Moggridge as the ‘father of interaction design’. 
							<br/><br/>
							Interaction design is directed to improve the using and understanding of digital projects.14
							In 1982 Moggridge worked for Grid Systems, where he developed the ‘Grid Compass’, the first laptop computer, which was designed to fit the size of a briefcase. At the time the laptop was too expensive for common public with its value of eight thousand dollar. So then it was mainly used by the military and was even present in space shuttles.15
							<br/><br/>
							Moggrdige his fascination is not the box, but rather the software inside. Apparently that had triggered the idea that design could become more than just some beautiful and convenient object. He thought more about providing others something that would meet the experience14. Something that was practical and would satisfy the needs of the users. He anticipated on the (future) needs of society and developed products that nowadays we cannot do without. In an interview about his book ‘Design Interactions’ Moggridge said he “would have to learn to design the interactive technology instead of just the physical object.” Here he was clearly aware of how important interactions were in order to provide in the consumer’s needs.
							<br/><br/>
							When working for IDEO, Moggridge changed his focus from specific projects to working on the process for design, by having engineers, designers, anthropologist and psychologists teaming up. He also started to teach on the importance of approachable design in daily life. With the Grid Compass Moggridge offered a great development in the digital technology, something that we nowadays still profit from. He started to think about the user and their needs, he showed them good intentions and understanding. In return he was absorbing new information, techniques, ideas, opinions, in order to develop his design and with that improving the user experience.
							<br/><br/>
							It is not a matter of which places his ideas could work. For it obviously has already worked. All over the world laptops have been developed and practically everywhere people profit from that. His idea about creating good experiences for the user is an idea that many brands use in designing their products. Luckily there is no patent on being inspired by other people’s ideas and philosophies.
							<br/><br/>
							BRET VICTOR <br/>
							<a class="quote">“I have committed my life to inventing a dynamic medium for human beings to see the unseeable, discuss the undiscussable, think the unthinkable.”</a> 16
							<br/><br/>
							Bret Victor says it himself on his website: he is committed. Commitment is a form of hospitality whereas you offer your loyalty and help to someone or something else. On top of that he provides people a new space where they can develop. Besides that he has an MS in Electrical Engineering, there is not much personal information to find about Victor. Only in his own words he writes an entire philosophic transformation through his studies and work-life. He ends that personal philosophy with:
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“The True Way transcends the minutia of Skill. There is no ‘Technology’. There is no ‘Design’. There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so. The rest is details.”</a>17
							<br/><br/>
							Yes, he says there is ‘no design’. This should have let my designer-heart break and dissociate from these hard words. Though I can relate to having a vision. Truth is, Victor has more visions. For one, he represents the belief that we should actually use computers for exploration and communication, but in such way, that all possibilities of a programmable, dynamic and interactive medium can be achieved. Easier said: to use programs in a more understandable and effective way. For example, how coding could feel more ‘like doodling than writing’ and that work normally done by your mind, would become work you could do with your body.
							<br/><br/>
							Victor describes his goal as ‘intention to invent a humane medium in which the thinkers of the next century will see, understand, and create systems.’ Though there can be a division in a short-, and long-term goal for Victor.18 Short-term: to make innovations regarding the way people learn, understand and create. Inno- vations in tools or products to equip scientist and researchers to find their cures and solutions; developing tools for artists to help them create better work; creating platforms for companies to easier share their knowledge or products. Ways that might not seem available right now. On the longer term he aspires to ‘fix’ this so-called immature society. He finds himself in some sort of dispute against the consumerist society and by providing the right tools he offers people the opportunity to join. The goal is to make sure the individual gets back their control, self-respect and responsibility.
							<br/><br/>
							Genuinely Victor provides the people with new ways to develop themselves. When a person dedicates himself and all of his time to others, that would be a definition of hospitality. He tries to invent a medium thus the next generation can see, can understand and are able to create systems. This is his hospitality: providing the next generation with possibilities. For future society to function well he aspires to make people able to ‘see, understand and think what needs to be seen, understood and thought.’
							<br/><br/>
							By giving innovations that can be applied to tools or products to help others, like scientists and researchers, they are able to make progress in what they do. All for the benefit of (next generation) society. What is important is that he gives a new way, perhaps the right way, of thinking. He does that with the idea that ‘people can think thoughts that they couldn’t think before.’
							<br/><br/>
							It is his philosophy and his goals that can be useful in many aspects of design. Atop of that Victor keeps his eyes on the future. He hopes to make this world a better and mature place for our next generation. A virtue of hospitality is that men anticipates one’s needs, and Victor anticipates this generation justly enough to prepare for the next.
							<br/><br/>
							KENYA HARA <br/>
							Since the whole starting point of my research on hospitality came from the Japanese culture, I could not leave out the utter most important designer from Japan.* Hara had been one of my main inspirations, and still is when I make a new design. The simplicity in his design with powerful visual communication is a refined skill Hara has mastered.
							<br/><br/>
							When I travelled around Japan I often visited a MUJI café, where Hara has been the advisor and art-director since 2002. This delicate design that seems very basic, yet elegant, is what draws you to spend hours in their cafés and shops. (Despite the fact that the prices are a little above average and a coffee with pie can cost roughly more than ten Euros.) When looking at the interior I wondered, what makes MUJI so attractive to the public?
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“I don’t believe cities are created by great urban designers. Cities are made by the desires of people. What designers are able to do is provide a little awakening that might change what people want from a city. That will eventually lead to a [larger] change.”</a>19
							<br/><br/>
							In an interview from the Japan Times19 Hara mentioned the philosophy of “education of desire”. This philosophy set ones sight on how change is made. That it is not per definition the designer that makes the change, but encourage people to think about what they want to see differently. A designer considers these opinions while designing. This philosophy is maintained in his work at MUJI.
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“Desire and education are both words that seem too direct, but I haven’t found any better. . . . Design must be a slow, quiet education that gradually exerts influence on the quality of need — the standard of the desire.”</a> 19
							<br/><br/>
							Hara is very focussed on the idea that design should implicate what the public asks for. It is a learning process. Good design does not just come from a designer suddenly having a great idea. It must have been anticipation and understanding, a perhaps rather long way of observing before finding solutions. Plus, in his book ‘Designing Design’ he writes that he is ‘not interested in creating messages against something,’20 he rather thinks design should take effect in a planning process.
							<br/><br/>
							With this concept of ‘educational desire’ the Japanese essence of simplicity is woven in the design of MUJI, where ‘This will do.’ is fundamentally aspired. It teaches the people to not think about all the details and extras a towel can contain, but adequately agrees that a plain towel ‘will do’. He believes that this idea can be realized by an awareness that goes beyond the beautiful object and more towards the experience of it, quite the same as Bill Moggridge thought of functionality before appearance. In Hara’s opinion, the future of Japanese design should concern better questions and not so much focus on forging better solutions. (Which is actually in contrast with the ideas of developers like Bill Moggridge and Bret Victor, who rather aspire solutions.)
							<br/><br/>
							Hara reflects on how Japanese design can be improved by revitalizing the traditional aspects of Japan’s history into a modern society. That of course is followed by further develop- ment for the future with an eye on designing products that are not just beautiful or functional, but contain cultural qualities
							as well. That might be the very reason why MUJI functions so well. Especially in Japanese culture, where the Japanese both care for newness and development, as they like to hold onto their traditions.
							<br/><br/>
							<a class="quote">“I’m not trying to go back to the past and say it’s beautiful and wonderful but, just like unearthing minerals, I’m trying to unearth those resources from the past as energy to propel us into the future.”</a>
							<br/><br/>
							If you have ever been to Japan and visited a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn, you might have experienced that it is a very un- surpassed experience, nothing compared to abundant Western style hotels. It offers exquisite service, the true omotenashi in
							a traditional way. This provides a richness in all its simplicity. Much more richness than the abundance of the West can ever target. Unfortunately ryokans are becoming a ‘dying phenomenon’ for it is quite expensive and customers rather pay less money for exaggerated but not qualitative service.
							<br/><br/>
							This reflection on traditional Japan brings me back to the omotenashi that I’ve been reaching out for. Unfortunately the essence of Japanese hospitality has been turned into a rather consumerist concept. Which is quite sad, for the whole idea of unselfish service is what made Japanese culture so interesting in the first place. Though I can agree with Hara’s ideology of reaching back on traditional behaviour, to learn from the past and use that as a foundation for better design in the future.

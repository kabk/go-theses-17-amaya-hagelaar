					It might be important to define hospitality to begin with. What is hospitality? Is it the woman behind the counter in a restaurant, helping you with your order? Is it the man at the train station, almost missing his own train because he wants to make sure you will catch yours? Is it the woman who promises to take care of you so you won’t feel lonely? Or the colleagues who speaks Japanese to you, because they know you want to learn it?
					<br/><br/>
					In the Oxford English Dictionary, hospitality is simply described as ‘the friendly and generous treatment of guests or strangers.’ Yet, hospitality can be much more than just good treatment. It can be the charity for the people that are in need. The nobleness of lifesavers. The graciousness of a landlord, king or president. Serviceability in cafés, regarding size or profit. The unselfishness of the young child. The sociability of the colleague or fellow- student. The self-devotion of the artist. It is the cordial friend, neighbourliness, a warmth and welcoming family... It is all around you.
					<br/><br/>
					Hospitality is about letting yourself be vulnerable and open for newness and change. To have an open mind and non-judgement towards other cultures. To show trust, compassion and under- standing. Trying to anticipate the needs of others and do your best to provide them with the necessities. Humans help each other, no matter in which country you are, what language you speak or how much time and effort it takes. There are many forms of hospitality, that vary between different cultures. Since I was almost obsessed with the idea of Japanese hospitality I shall explain to you what I have learned about this cultural phenomenon.
					<br/><br/>
					OMOTENASHI<br/>
					Omotenashi, the art of selfless hospitality. A term hard to translate in any other language. It can be interpreted in different ways. Some say it means ‘service without expectation of reward’, others translate it into ‘kindness from the heart’. A few Japanese even explained it to me as simply ‘love us’.
					<br/><br/>
					Originally the concept of omotenashi is said to come from the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The host would entertain and serve the guests as generously as possible, without expecting anything in return. It is a selfless form of service that has found its way in many aspects of Japanese society and can still be found to this day. The Japanese have a high sense of responsibility (sometimes so extreme that they are afraid to take the respon- sibility and to make decisions) and try to anticipate others needs so they can respond in the best way. This philosophy can be found in the effort that is put in preparations and arrangements. It is the fuel for the behaviour and attitude towards guests. Omotenashi can even be found in the way people dress to certain occassions.1 As a designer I notice the way it is also used in their designs.
					<br/><br/>
					Generally this word is an ideology used for customers. Japanese hosts would provide the customers with the best service. However, after living in Japan for three months I realised the Japanese live by the rules and omotenashi is one of them. True, they are very kind and helpful. Though, when you look closer and long enough you notice that it is mostly towards tourists and only when they need to. This realisation changed my whole view on the omotenashi principles. The word might be Japanese, but for me the concept is nothing specific to only the Japanese culture anymore. At least not how I interpret the word. The essence, to me, is not just about providing good service, but also putting your heart and soul into it, and showing hospitality not because you have to, but purely because you want to. It should not just contain a service on the spot, but rather a continuous solution. It should be possible to apply this kind of philosophy or lifestyle into any field and any situation.
					<br/><br/>
					PERSONAL EXPERIENCE<br/>
					Hopefully you do not understand me wrong when I express my experience regarding the Japanese hospitality. It has not been a negative experience at all, just a revelation that made it possible for me to look objectively to this interesting subject. I would like to clarify my experiences with three examples:
					<br/><br/>
					Firstly, the most general way of hospitality in Japan. Hospitality by rules. It was even an extreme form of hospitality, as I am about to explain. During my last weeks in Japan I went to Disney Seaworld. Wherever we went, employees would walk around and show everyone their brightest smile, waving continuously and wishing us a beautiful day. Without interrupting this seemingly ritual, they walked through the park. It is hard to understand how they trained their cheeks and arm muscles enabling them to do this successively throughout the day. Even though their smile looked the sincerest you would ever see in the park, it felt a bit like pretence after a while.

					<br/><br/>
					Secondly, and a little less ‘because they have to’, two stewards from PeachFly helped me when I missed my flight. There was only one seat available on the next flight, that would be boarding in an hour. So with minutes rushing by we tried to book that flight. There were many difficulties as the seat first seemed to be reserved; later I could not book the flight because the internet on my phone did not work, but the woman generously made an exception and used her phone to book instead; then I apparently exceeded the limit of my creditcard, so I had to contact my mother for her creditcard (for which I was lucky to be able to reach her, since there was a time difference of eight hours)... Only half an hour to spare, all the desks were empty and only the three of us were left. They felt the pressure as much as I did, or perhaps even more as they cheered even louder than me when I was finally able to book the ticket. I thanked them as often as I could and rewarded them with a little present that I always carried with me for gestures of hospitality like these. They were overjoyed and even wrote down very detailed where I had to go next to
					be in time for boarding. At the gate the woman passed by and anymore. At least not how I interpret the word. The essence, to me, is not just about providing good service, but also putting your heart and soul into it, and showing hospitality not because you have to, but purely because you want to. It should not just contain a service on the spot, but rather a continuous solution. It should be possible to apply this kind of philosophy or lifestyle into any field and any situation.
					 
					thanked me for the present. She greeted me a hundred times before I was out of sight, safely inside the plane. Undoubtedly helping me was their job, but they went as far as using their own telephone and trying every possible option in order to get me on that flight. They were not obliged to do so much for me, yet they did, and I sensed they showed me the true hospitality from the heart.
					<br/><br/>
					HOSPITALITY OF THE WORLD<br/>
					Obviously omotenashi is not the only form of hospitality on	this planet. There are many different countries with different cultures that have their own philosophy regarding behaviour towards others. After omotenashi I learned about the Ubuntu.
					A rather fascinating philosophy that has its origin in South Africa and can be translated to “I am what I am because of who we
					all are”2 Is that not the truest form of a sincere kind of unity? It is a way of understanding one-self in relation to the rest of the world. You only exist because the others exist and your individual success and fortune is less important than that of the group.
					<br/><br/>
					In this world we are all interconnected. Therefore understanding each other is of great importance, in order to live together in harmony. There is so much more to discover and I shall not stop my search for other ways of hospitality. Even though I might stumble upon the same realisation I had with omotenashi: that
					it is perhaps not as magnificent and perfect as it seems to be
					at first glance. That it has both its positive as negative sides. However, these different points of view makes it even more interesting to experience. You take the good with the bad and learn from it what you can in pursuance of an improved society, and in this case, better design.

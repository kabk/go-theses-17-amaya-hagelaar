							Can we apply hospitality into the world of design? Eventually there seem to be many ways to interpret hospitality. Many things can be part of the concept of omotenashi, from the designing of tools, to offering solutions or even placing a figurative mirror in front of the public, in order to encourage them.
							<br/><br/>
							Developers like Bill Moggridge and designers like Dave Hakkens proved that their form of hospitality can be of use or meaning to others in this world. This is possible because they learned to anticipate on society’s needs, offer possibilities and by designing tools that contain efficiency. Not only to make a change, but to help society develop on its own strength. But with the design of a functional machine comes more than just offering practicality. Hakkens for example took a few steps further by explaining how to make your own machine. Hospitality in design is about offering opportunities and possibilities together with the solutions they created.
							<br/><br/>
							Since hospitality can also be interpreted in the broadest sense it is not difficult to find a way to offer something to another being (whether it is a human, animal, or Mother Nature herself) without receiving something directly in return. With all good intentions you can create an environment, a space, for the public to feel comfortable or feel like they can move forward. Perhaps a company like MUJI might offer consumerism as well, it is still using the Japanese omotenashi to form a comfortable place and contains the essence of what Japanese hospitality characterized in the past.
							<br/><br/>
							Many projects have been done by people from different disciplines. What they all have in common is that they offered the public something, the public participated and eventually continued the amelioration. People can be lazy or uneducated, but nevertheless be willing to make a change. They need to get a little push to make that step and that is where designers are for. To help a hand in crossing that bridge. In valuing lives, in solving that riddle.
							<br/><br/>
							Though it has to be taken into account for which kind of public you are designing and what the results might be. As where the Japanese train stations do not provide more information that just the word ‘INFORMATION’. Here the hospitality might take a few steps higher on the steps of helpfulness. Necessary information should be availabe for everyone new to the situation.
							<br/><br/>
							So yes, it is certainly possible to apply the art of Japanese hospitality into the world of design. A designer should not only design a handy product or confronting event, but make it an accessible experience for the public as well. It is difficult nowadays to get the attention of this digital generation, only looking down on their phones. So what thrives these people to look up? Something that is inviting and capturing. Things that make you think or help you further. It does not have to be presented on a silver platter, as long as the platter is an unforgettable (and perhaps life-changing) experience.

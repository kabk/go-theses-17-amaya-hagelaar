			<h2> ABSTRACT </h2>
			<p> 
				Omotenashi is the art of selfless hospitality, a way of life only known in Japan. The host pays anticipates on the guestsâ€™ needs and offers the guest a once-in-a-life-time experience. According to Japanese the essence is to put their heart and soul into it.
				<br/>
				How can this form of hospitality be applied in graphic design? How as a designer can I provide the public - for example in the digital platform - in their needs, before they even realise they needed it? After all, that is what omotenashi stands for.
				<br/>
				This research will be extended by finding out how to apply omotenashi without losing our sense of self and not get lost in the digital platform. Since this form of hospitality makes the Japanese lose their sense of personality in a way, while they live to work for the society and thereby forget theirselves.

							HOSPITALITY<br/>
							Hospitality has always been a fascination to me. It started with the kindness my parents always showed throughout my life. Things like inviting people for dinner, or letting my friends stay over and taking care of them as if they were their ‘temporary children’. They showed love to everyone around them and when we were buying groceries at the market they stopped almost every five minutes to talk to acquaintances. I admire that openness my family has. Habits I gladly took over when I became older.
							<br/><br/>
							Gestures like my parents’ or even from strangers I encountered on the street made me wonder, where does that kindness come from? What forms of kindness and hospitality are there in this world? Somehow from my interest for Japanese culture I learned about ‘omotenashi’, the grandest form of hospitality in Japan.
							<br/><br/>
							A dream to go to Japan blossomed inside me and after my first holiday there that interest grew into an almost obsessive fascination. I had experienced omotenashi and I wanted to have more of it! Last year I finally took the big step that I have been looking forward to for a long time and moved to Japan for three months. In Tokyo I did an internship at a Graphic Design studio and made several short trips around Japan to research that fascinating concept of hospitality.
							<br/><br/>
							However, my love bubble had developed some cracks. It struck me like lightning when reality showed that this art of hospitality was not what I had expected it to be. Suddenly all this kindness had become like oil floating on a watery surface; strict rules that the Japanese live by; gestures they make because they have to, not from their hearts. At one point, omotenashi in my opinion had not so much to do with the Japanese culture I encountered. All that helpfulness in shops, restaurants and hotels is great for tourists, but once you live there for a longer time you see that it is just a way to make foreigners ‘like them’.
							<br/><br/>
							The behaviour of Japanese people can be somewhat contradicting. At one point they are extremely social and loyal to their company, working hard to have this society run as smooth as a bullet train, even offering tourists the best possible service. On the other hand many seem to have a closed personality, not sharing their feelings with others, not daring to take responsibilities, not remarking other people’s flaws, even though it might be helpful from time to time. Kind gestures are sometimes not even truthful. Japanese offer business cards as leafs falling from trees in autumn, though when they say you should swing by their house when you are in the neighbourhood, they do not actually mean it. The interesting thing about this situation is that many Japanese I have talked to even admit all I have noticed. So apparently it is not just my personal view upon this culture, but the Japanese interpretation of their own culture as well.
							<br/><br/>
							Anyway, it is not that I do not like the way they treated me, or that all Japanese only do it because they have to. I often experienced true hospitality from Japanese families, colleagues and roommates, as well as I received the same kindness from European colleagues or random strangers from Mexico, US or Germany. During my stay I even met some Dutch people that gladly took care of me. So concluding from that, I no longer take the concept of omotenashi as a specific Japanese lifestyle, but rather as a kindness from the heart that can be experience all over the world from every living being. It is this concept of anticipating the needs of others in order to develop for a better future, that I would like to apply into graphic design, so it could contribute to the benefit of our society.
							<br/><br/>
							Adding to this experience in Japan I realised hospitality does not stop at human services. There is more to it. The way signs are hung, menus in restaurants are written, different languages are provided... It all says a lot about either a person, a country or a company. Some things look impossible for people to understand. And sometimes the people are unable to help you (due to lack of English skills.) This either requires an update
							of the information or a tool to help you better understand. Eventually hospitality does not seem only to be something from human directly to human. It could also be experienced through a form of design in the broadest sense.
							<br/><br/>
							As a graphic designer I wonder in what different ways we can use hospitality. What are the possibilities to apply this art of hospitality into the world of design? Or can we translate omotenashi to another way of communication? In this thesis I shall define my understanding of omotenashi and how it can be experienced in Japanese culture. That will be followed with an observation on how designers have used a form of hospitality in their own way.
